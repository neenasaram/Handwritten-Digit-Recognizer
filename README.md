# Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer
**This is a simple Handwritten Digit Recognition web app built using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained on the MNIST dataset. Users can upload images of digits (0â€“9), and the app will predict the digit using a trained model.**

**Built with TensorFlow, Keras, and Streamlit**

### Features
+ Trained on MNIST dataset (60,000 training & 10,000 testing images)
+ Uses a basic ANN with two hidden layers
+ Web interface built using Streamlit
+ Users can upload digit images (28x28 grayscale) for prediction
